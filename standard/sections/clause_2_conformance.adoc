== Conformance

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using the tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document.

_OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval_ (EDR) provides a family of lightweight interfaces to access Environmental Data resources. Each resource addressed by an EDR API maps to a defined query pattern.  This standard is a profile/extension of EDR.  Conformance to this standard requires demonstrated conformance to the applicable Conformance Classes of _OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval - Part 1: Core_.

Implementors of EDR API within the RODEO project are required to comply with the RODEO EDR Profile.  A RODEO EDR API shall therefore be compliant with OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval - Part 1: Core.

This standard identifies the following Requirements Classes which define the functional requirements.

* "Core": baseline requirements class required by all other requirements classes in this document
* "Observations": TBD
* "Radar": TBD

Compliant implementation of this profile requires conformance to at least the "Core" Requirements Class.
